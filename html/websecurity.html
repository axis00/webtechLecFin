                <h3>Web Security Threats</h3>
                <p>
                    Web security threats are any malicious activity that may attack any application connected to the web. These threats can take different forms, and they may affect the applications' behavior and data. It is important to be aware of these threats so they could be avoided. There are different web threats that exist today.There are also brand new threats that come up time to time. In the next part of this discussion, there are three common web security threats to be discussed. These are Injection, Broken Authentication, and Cross-Site Scripting. As computer science students, website users, and possible future web developers, it is necessary for us to be aware of these threats and their effects. It is best for us to be equipped with knowledge about them, so that we will be cautious when performing online activities and developing web applications.

                    The Philippine government is taking part in securing the web and its users' privacy by establishing an organization dedicated to it. National Privacy Commission or NPC is an independent body that takes charge in administering and implementing the Data Privacy Act of 2012. This organization works to be in line with international regualtion such as General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR. NPC also enforces and implements data protection and privacy standards required by the regulation.

            <div id="injection">
                <h3>Injection</h3>
                <p>This web security threat is ranked as number one threat in OWASP Top 10 for 2017. It is one of the most common and threatening security attack today. An injection attack happens when a malicious input is entered into a web application. This input can be a command, query, or malware. Once this input is injected in the program, the interpreter may change the behavior of the program. These attacks could result to having an access and/or any modification to the website’s database which can have a negative impact on businesses and organizations. </p>

                <p>The most common type among injection attacks is SQL Injection. Some SQL queries can be entered in website's input field. This queries will be interpreted if the developer did not use prepared statements. If this kind of attack is successful, the hacker can then gain access to the website's database.</p>

            <div id="broken">
                <h3>Broken Authentication</h3>
                

                <p>
                    An attack caused by bad implementation of the authentication and/or session management of a web application is considered as a broken authentication. When the authentication and session management aren’t handled or implemented properly, attackers can gain access to passwords and/or session tokens. They could also have access to a user’s data in his/her account which could potentially lead to violation of privacy.

                </p>

                <p>
                    There are multiple example and kinds of attack on authentication and cases of Broken Authentication. A new kind of attack on authentication is Credential Stuffing. Credential Stuffing is a kind of brute force where an attacker with access to leaked credentials will try to match the credentials to an existing account. The attacker will then have access to the said account and do as the attacker pleases. OWASP sited a reason why authentication attacks commonly occur is because websites rely purely on passwords as authentication to access an account. This can be a reason why Credential Stuffing is common. This kind of attack can be prevented if websites don’t purely rely on passwords.

                    Incorrect application of session timeouts or the lack of it is also an example of Broken Authentication. The most popular example for this is forgetting to properly logout an account and immediately closing the browser. Without proper session handling, another person can use the same browser and have access of the previous user’s account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fortunately, attacks on authentication and cases of Broken Authentication can be dealt with almost all of the if not all the time. An example for mitigating authentication attacks is adding an additional layer of protection for accounts. A common way how some sites do this is through Multi-Factor Authentication. This is usually done by sending a confirmation code to a personal device of the registered user before the sites grant access to the account.

            <div id="xss">
                <h3>Cross-Site Scripting</h3>
                <p>Cross-Site Scripting or XSS is an attack that attacks the website users instead of targetting the website. It is similar to Injection attacks. However, this occurs when an attacker embed scripts that would run on a victim's browser without the victims knowledge. This can occur often since modern browsers are capable of running scripts.</p>

                <img src="xss.png ">
                <p>An example of this attack is the persistent XSS. This happens when a malicious script is stored in the server by posting comments, forum posts, or other input fields. Another example is the reflected XSS, where scripts are indicated in a URL.</p>
